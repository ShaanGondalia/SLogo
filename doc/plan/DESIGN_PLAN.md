made from [a tool that generates UML from existing code](http://staruml.io/).

Here is our amazing UI:

## Introduction

## Overview

## User Interface

The interface will be separated into separate windows, all of which will show up upon
initialization. Each of the windows will represent something, aka. Commands, Variables, and
TurtleView just to start.

The user will interact only with the CommandWindow, as to keep things simple. Colors will mostly be
gray, black, and white for the command and variable windows, while the turtle window will be more
colorful as necessitated by the specifications. Attached is a wireframe.

Erroneous situations will be reported through JavaFX alerts, as again to keep things simple. Such
situations include bad functions, by showing an alert, and these errors will be handled by an Errors
Front-end class.
