## Wish Simulation API

### External

* Goals
    * step method to run simulation
    * getSingleCellState to pass to the view
    * getNumberOfCells for statistics
* Contract
    * step will never have any parameters
    * model will always contain the cell information
* Services
    * the simulation will allow for the view class to easily display all relevent information about
      the simulation that is going on. However, it will not let any other classes change what is
      going on in the simulation, and it will not reveal the details of how the simulation is run.
