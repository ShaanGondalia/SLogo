## Current Simulation API

### External

* Identified Classes/Methods

* Goals

* Contract

* Services


### Internal

* Identified Classes/Methods

int nextState(int i, int j);
returns next state of cell

step();
steps simulation

* Goals

Allow Simulation to be extended to create new kinds of simulations and features

* Contract

anything related to a specific cell takes in i, j parameters

* Services

steps simulation
accessing next state
